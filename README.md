# Red-Black Binary Search Tree Generator

This program uses Java to visualize red-black binary search trees in the user's terminal. This project was completed as the final project for my CMPSC202 class. This program demonstrated that I understood red-black trees, their add and delete functionalities, and can implement in a visual manner.

## Running the Program

To run the program, you will first need to clone the repository to your machine. Once the repository is cloned, navigate into it and the RedBlackBST folder it contains:

```
cd red-black-tree-generator/RedBlackBST
```

Then run the program by entering the following command:

```
java RedBlackBST
```

The program should begin running, welcoming you and prompting you to enter a series of numbers separated by spaces. Once you are finished entering numbers, type 'end' and hit enter. The program will generate your red-black tree and display it for you. You can then choose to either add a new node, delete an existing node, or quit by entering the corresponding number.
